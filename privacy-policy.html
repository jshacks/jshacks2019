        <h3>9. SECURITY</h3>
        <p class="text-small">
          The security of your Personal Data is important to us. Your Personal
          Data will therefore be processed by applying reasonable technical and
          organizational measures to protect Personal Data, such as limiting
          access to Personal Data, encryption or anonymization of Personal Data,
          storage on secure environments. However, despite our efforts, we
          cannot always guarantee the effectiveness of the security measures
          implemented, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of
          Personal Data at any time.
